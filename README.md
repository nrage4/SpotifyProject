# Spotify_Artist_Data-Project

I discovered a dataset called Spotify Artist data on Kaggle and imported it into PyCharm. The collection contained information on various musicians and the number of streams they have received.

Project Structure:


1) ER Diagram

Created an ER Diagram to identify the primary key, which was ID and only use the necessary columns needed to create a SQL table for the next step.

2) SQL Table

Created a SQL table using the information provided in the dataset and also insert the information into the table.

3) Groupby method (Pandas)

Grouped two columns, artist name and lead streams together by using the groupby function
